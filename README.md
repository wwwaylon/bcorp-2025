# Workshop "Latent variable modeling in behavioral and clinical outcomes research: A practical guide"

## [Waylon Howard](https://wwwaylon.github.io/)

## Overview

This session is designed to summarize structural equation modeling theory and analysis from an applied research perspective. The first part of the workshop is intended to summarize key terms and theory. Then we will discuss techniques for fitting models. For those interested I have provided examples that demonstrate many fundamental points with an emphasis on general concepts over calculations. All examples are available for download.

## Learning objectives

Upon workshop completion, we should

1. Understand the benefits of confirmatory factor analysis in enhancing estimation accuracy.
2. Gain insight into the derivation of numerical outputs from the model. 
3. Gain proficiency in applying Mplus, R, and SAS code to implement specific models.

## Audience & Prerequisites

This session is intended for a general research audience, especially those interested in latent variable modeling from a basic applied research perspective. The workshop assumes some basic understanding of statistics and the use of multiple item scales but is largely self-contained. The workshop will reference examples using basic statistical analyses (e.g., regression), for which a familiarity would be useful. However, these analyses are not the focus of this workshop.
